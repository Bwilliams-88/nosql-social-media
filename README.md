# NoSQL Social Media

## Description

For this assignment we were tasked with building an API for a social networking web application using express and mongoose with mongoDB. I am starting to find the assignments to be a little easier...a little. I was able to get all the API routes to work on the user and thoughts schema although I am still working on getting the friends and friends list to work.
